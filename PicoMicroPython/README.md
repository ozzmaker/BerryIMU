### My Updates
I've put the IMU liraries in classes so pins can be specified in the main program, rather than having to modify the library to do so. The relevant code has been included to make it work. Additionally, a typo in the LM6DSL lookup table has been fixed. That has been sent up the chain to see if it gets repaired in the main fork.
